## ClinicWAIT API

CliniWait is an Node.js API to improve walk-in clinics line-up systems. the API provides interface to :   

* search a walk-in clinic based on geolocation*   
* know how engorged a clinic is before going there   
* register remotely to see a doctor   
* follow the evolution of traffic and track your position   
* cancel your registration anytime when needeed   

*dependencies : part of the clinics informations and geolocation is taken from Google Places API.

It's actually a personal experimentation just to explore Node.js and all its underlying paradigm.
